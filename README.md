# React Synthesiser

### Summary
This is a synthesiser(or synthesizer) and step-sequencer web app I have created in collaboration with @jamesclarkson97 (https://github.com/jamesclarkson97) to use as my final project for CodeClan.

### Technologies
#### Front-end
* React
* JavaScript
* Tone.js
* Web MIDI API
* CSS(Vanilla)

#### Back-end
* Express.js
* JavaScript/Node.js
* MongoDB

### How To Run
To run this app on your local machine:
* Clone this repository.
* Have Node.js installed, then navigate to the project folder and run terminal command npm i or npm install in both client and server folders to install dependancies.
* In server folder, run command npm run server:dev in terminal to start the express server. Leave this open in background.
* In client folder run command npm start in terminal to start the main application. Leave this open in background.
* React should automatically open the app in your browser, if not just type localhost:3000 in your browser. It should now be running!
